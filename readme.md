This project uses the React library to build the **client-side** component for the movie application SYFYMovies, based on its existing [server-side code (REST API and database)](https://github.com/eggsistentialarugula/SYFYMovies_API). It includes serveral interface views that handles data through the defined REST API endpoints.

Combined with the [Server-Side component](https://github.com/eggsistentialarugula/SYFYMovies_API), this web application utilizes the _**MERN stack**_, which consists of _MongoDB_, _Express_, _React_, and _Node.js_.
